            <h2>Welcome to Zoo Escape!</h2>
            <p>Zoo Escape is a story driven text-based Python game where you get to choose one of four zoo animals to
                play as - each with their own story to tell. Your goal: escape the zoo by any means necessary. The
                motivation for this daring breakout is to reach a theoretical destination called 'Cotton Candy Land'
                whch is said to be an animal paradise outside of the Zoo, where animals govern themselves and live
                freely.</p>

            <p>Let's set the scene for a minute</p>

            <p>Starting off in your enclosure, you begin to plot your escape. The zoo escape experience will take you
                through five 'levels' where you'll be presented with three choices for how to proceed. Use all of your
                animal wit to make the correct choices to progress. One wrong move could lead to your recapture, keeping
                you from ever reaching Cotton Candy Land.</p>

            <p>Get to know our four brave animals, ready to make their escape</p>

                path to freedom will be different every playthrough. Your choices affect the ending your animal gets.

            <h1>Outline of Development</h1>
        </label>
        <div class="collapsible-text">
            <h2>How did we come up with this crazy idea you may ask?</h2>
            <p>
                It all started during a long Discord chat amongst ourselves, throwing around ideas for the game's theme. Playing as a variety of chosen animals escaping a zoo just stuck with us, and we all agreed to go forward with the concept.
                We discussed characters, attributes, choices, the story narrative, and most importantly - how to make the game fun! We've created a game with many different paths to completion. Some breakouts bordering on being outlandish, others outright hilarious.
                By the end of the 3 1/2 work days we had a finished product that met the clients specifications and satisfied the given brief.
                
            </p>
            <h2 class="left_side"> Breakdown of our development process:</h2>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Planning - Before we could begin writing any code, we had to agree on the game's 'architecture' and all of the different animal choices and their attribute values, 'requirements' for each successful action. A Figma flowchart was perfect for this, and really helped us break the 
                    game's code own into managable chunks.</li><br>
                <li>Assigning tasks - As a team, we had another talk about each of our skill sets before assigning tasks to members best suited. We broke down the workload for making the game into numerous small tasks set on Trello that we could all access.
                    This allowed us to see who was working on which tasks and whether they had finished or not. Trello also - like Figma - helped to map out our thoughts and make writing the game code not such a difficult task.</li><br>
                <li>Classes, objects and character selection - The logical first place to start when making this kind of game. This part of the game took a lot of discussion time during the planning, but once completed set a foundation to begin level 1 with. 
                    No other section/level of the game could be written without this being done first. </li><br>
                <li>level 1 completion - Once the code for level 1 was completed, the 'template' for the levels proceeding it was set for other members of the team to follow. This meant that multiple game levels could be 
                    written at the same time.</li><br>
                <li>File sharing - At this stage we made sure that everyone had a copy of the first level, character selection, and the classes/objects - the building blocks for the rest of the game. Only then could we really speed up the development process as well as start properly 
                    testing each other's code.</li><br>
                <li>testing - TESTING, TESTING, TESTING. All members of the team played through every animal character and every choice to test for incorrect outcomes for choices and user input value errors during every development stage. Because of this, we caught more than a few bugs 
                    before it was too late to make the required changes to the code.</li><br>
                <li>Game completion v1 - Once the first version of the entire game code was finished, we could then properly test and assess the way it functions and fits the 
                    brief - playing for less than 5 mins etc.</li><br>
                <li>Revisions and extra features - Now team members began to start making small final revisions to the game code in the main game file and sharing it back to one-another. Now non-essential feature were starting to be added, such as the typewriter animation - so that the game really 'feels' story-driven with a strong narrative - and the end credits sequence.</li>
            </ol>

        <div class="collapsible-text">
            <h2 class="left_side"> Our best qualities as a Team:</h2>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Organisation - Agreeing on the game's 'architecture' and mapping it using a Figma flowchart beforehand 
                    ended up being extremely helpful at keeping us all on the same path whilst 
                    working separately.</li><br>
                <li>Assigning tasks - We broke down the workload for making the game into numerous small tasks set on Trello that we could all access.
                    This allowed us to see who was working on which tasks and whether they had finished or not.</li><br>
                <li>Communication - This is key for a team project. We all got along well and were always available on Discord during work hours to discuss problems and solutions with 
                    one-another, helping the development process along.</li><br>
                <li>Testing - We all got involved in testing each others code at multiple stages throughout development, giving feedback to ensure no game breaking code was
                    left unchecked.</li><br>
                <li>Morale/motivation - Maintaining a positive atmosphere - even during development roadblocks and personal issues outside of work - was crucial and kept the team together through tough 
                    times right up until development completion.</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>What We Would Have Done Differently</h1>
        </label>
        <div class="collapsible-text">
            <h2 class="left_side">Ways our Team can improve efficiency:</h2>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Testing on a browser - This game being developed using Python isn't native to browsers, so testing
                    the game's compatibility more would've been beneficial.</li><br>
                <li>Comment on code more - Commenting on code is integral and should be used as often as possible, more comments
                    would have made the code more informative to other team members and potential increased the team's workrate.</li><br>
                <li>Realistic time frames - We underestimated how long certain tasks would take and didn't give ourselves that extra time just in case unexpected bugs/problems 
                    occured during the later stages of development. Being more aware of this would have allowed us to implement some of the other game functions that we had planned for.</li>
            </ul>
            </p>
            <h2 class="left_side">Game features we will add in the near future:</h2>
            <p>
            <ul>
                <li>Longer/deeper story - This was always going to be a limiting factor given the short game development time, 
                    but could have really benefitted from a longer, more fleshed out story sequence. Maybe even meeting and interection with other characters?</li><br>
                <li>Wait for night/day - A function to use for one of the levels that would have changes the time of day, 
                    affecting animal and human attributes - such as awareness - which would have made the difference and effected certain choice outcomes for certain animals.</li><br>
                <li>Number of lives - The current 'capture/escape' system was unforgiving - losing after one wrong choice. 
                    We would have changed this to allow for three 'lives', meaning a wrong choice can be retried within the same level before the zookeeper catches you.</li><br>
                <li>More animations - This game was made to be heavily narrative driven to make the best use of it being 
                    text-based. However, we think that including action-specific animations that run for every unique player choice in the game would've applified the immersion, time permitting.</li>
